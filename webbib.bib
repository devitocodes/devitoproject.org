	abstract = {This talk presents a serverless approach to seismic imaging in the cloud based on high-throughput containerized batch processing, event-driven computations and a domain-specific language compiler for solving the underlying wave equations. A 3D case study on Azure demonstrates that this approach allows reducing the operating cost of up to a factor of 6, making the cloud a viable alternative to on-premise HPC clusters for seismic imaging.},
