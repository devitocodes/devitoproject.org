title: Download and Install Devito
---

There are two main approaches to installing Devito.

- `Docker`, for those looking for the least-friction way to try Devito
- `Virtual environment`, for those looking to use Devito as part of a project alongside other packages

## Docker

### [Devito] Docker image library

In order to facilitate the dissemination, usage, and development of Devito, we provide a series of Docker images. These images support numerous architectures and compilers and are tagged accordingly. You can find all the available images at [DevitoHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/devitocodes/). The following describes the available images and the workflow to build it yourself. 

#### [Devito] images

Devito provides several images that target different architectures and compilers. In the following, all images are described as `imagename-*`. The `*` corresponds to, and should be swapped for, the different release tags `dev`, `latest` or `vx.x.x` depending on if you are interested in specific versions (`vx.x.x`), the latest stable release(`latest`), or the latest development status (`dev`).

#### [Devito] on CPU

We provide two CPU images:
- `devito:gcc-*` with the standard GNU gcc compiler.
- `devito:icx-*` with the Intel C compiler for Intel architectures.

These images provide a working environment for any CPU architecture and come with [Devito], `gcc/icx` and `mpi` preinstalled, and utilities such as `jupyter` for usability and exploration of the package.

To run this image locally, you will first need to install `docker`. Then, the following commands will get you started:

```bash
# Pull image and start a bash shell 
docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 -p 8786:8786 devitocodes/devito:gcc-latest /bin/bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 -p 8786:8786 --device=/dev/infiniband/uverbs0 --device=/dev/infiniband/rdma_cm devitocodes/devito:gcc-latest /bin/bash

# or start a Jupyter notebook server on port 8888
docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 devitocodes/devito:gcc-latest

```

Alternatively, to run in user context on a cluster with a shared filesystem, you can add the correct user config as `docker` options, e.g.:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` -u $(id -u):$(id -g) devitocodes/devito:gcc-latest python examples/seismic/acoustic/acoustic_example.py
```

**Notes**:
In addition, the following legacy tags are available:

- `devito:cpu-*` that corresponds to `devito:gcc-*`


#### [Devito] on GPU

Second, we provide three images to run [Devito] on GPUs, tagged `devito:nvidia-nvc-*`, and `devito:amd-*`.

- `devito:nvidia-nvc-*` is intended to be used on NVidia GPUs. It comes with the configuration to use the `nvc` compiler for `openacc` offloading. This image also comes with CUDA-aware MPI for multi-GPU deployment.
- `devito:amd-*` is intended to be used on AMD GPUs. It comes with the configuration to use the `aoompcc` compiler for `openmp` offloading. This image also comes with ROCm-aware MPI for multi-GPU deployment. This image can also be used on AMD CPUs since the ROCm compilers are preinstalled.

##### NVidia

To run the NVidia GPU version, you will need [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) installed and to specify the GPUs to use at runtime with the `--gpus` flag. See, for example, a few runtime commands for the NVidia `nvc` images.


```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 -p 8786:8786 devitocodes/devito:nvidia-nvc-latest
docker run --gpus all --rm -it devitocodes/devito:nvidia-nvc-latest python examples/seismic/acoustic/acoustic_example.py

docker run --gpus all --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 -p 8786:8786 --device=/dev/infiniband/uverbs0 --device=/dev/infiniband/rdma_cm  devitocodes/devito:nvidia-nvc-latest
```

or to run in user context on a cluster with a shared filesystem, you can add the correct user config as `docker` options, e.g.:

```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` -u $(id -u):$(id -g) devitocodes/devito:nvidia-nvc-latest python examples/seismic/acoustic/acoustic_example.py
```


##### AMD

Unlike NVidia, AMD does not require an additional Docker setup and runs with the standard docker. You will, however, need to pass some flags so that the image is linked to the GPU devices. You can find a short walkthrough in these [AMD notes](https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/ROCm%20Learning%20Centre/chapter5/Chapter5.3_%20KerasMultiGPU_ROCm.pdf) for their TensorFlow GPU Docker image.


**Notes**:
In addition, the following legacy tags are available:

- `devito:gpu-*` that corresponds to `devito:nvidia-nvc-*`


### Build a [Devito] image

To build the images yourself, you only need to run the standard build command using the provided Dockerfile. The main difference between the CPU and GPU images will be the base image used.


To build the (default) CPU image, run:

```bash
docker build --network=host --file docker/Dockerfile.devito --tag devito .
```

To build the GPU image with `openacc` offloading and the `nvc` compiler, run:

```bash
docker build --build-arg base=devitocodes/bases:nvidia-nvc --network=host --file docker/Dockerfile.devito --tag devito .
```

or if you wish to use the `amdclang` compiler with `openmp` offloading for AMD architectures:

```bash
docker build --build-arg base=devitocodes/bases:amd --network=host --file docker/Dockerfile --tag devito .
```

### Debugging a base image

To build the base image yourself locally, you need to run the standard build command using the provided Dockerfile.
Following this, we build the Devito image using the previously built base:

```bash
docker build . --file docker/Dockerfile.cpu --tag devito-gcc --build-arg arch=gcc
docker build . --file docker/Dockerfile.devito --tag devito_img --build-arg base=devito-gcc:latest
```

and then, to run tests or/and examples using the newly built image

```bash
docker run --rm --name testrun devito_img pytest -k "not adjoint" -m "not parallel" tests/
docker run --rm --name testrun devito_img py.test --nbval -k 'not dask' examples/seismic/tutorials/
```

### Developing Devito with Docker

For those aiming to develop in Devito using Docker, you can use docker-compose.
We start by cloning the repo and entering the Devito directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devitocodes/devito.git
cd devito
```

#### Example CPU

```bash
# Start a terminal to develop/run for CPUs using docker compose
docker-compose run devito /bin/bash
```

#### Example GPU
```bash
# Start a terminal to develop/run for GPUs using docker compose
docker-compose run devito.nvidia /bin/bash
```

## Virtual environment

### venv route

Devito is available as a `pip package` in PyPI.

Create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

```bash
python3 -m venv <your_venv_name>
```

Source the newly created `venv`. This needs to be repeated each time a new terminal is open.

```bash
source <your_venv_name>/bin/activate
```

To install the `latest Devito release` along with any additional dependencies, follow:

```bash
   pip install devito
   # ...or to install additional dependencies:
   # pip install devito[extras,mpi,nvidia,tests]
```

[latest Devito release](https://pypi.org/project/devito/#history)

To install the latest Devito development version, without the tutorials, follow:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/devitocodes/devito.git
# ...or to install additional dependencies:
# pip install devito[tests,extras,mpi] @ git+https://github.com/devitocodes/devito@master
```

Additional dependencies:

- extras : optional dependencies for Jupyter notebooks, plotting, benchmarking
- tests : optional dependencies required for testing infrastructure
- mpi : optional dependencies for MPI (mpi4py)
- nvidia : optional dependencies for targetting GPU deployment

[pip package](https://pypi.org/project/devito/)

Note that here, you do not need to get the code via `git clone`.
Depending on your needs, this might also be the recommended setup for using Devito
in a production-like environment. However, since some components need to be
compiled before use, this approach may be sensitive to the C/C++ compilers present
on your system and the related environment, including what other packages you might
have installed.


### conda route

Please install either [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
Once install, you can create a virtual environment with eithera [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or a [Conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html):

```bash
# Create new env with the name devito
conda create --name devito
# Activate the environment
conda activate devito
```

and finally, install Devito along with any extra dependencies:

```bash
pip install devito
# ... or to install additional dependencies
# pip install devito[extras,mpi,nvidia,tests]
```

### For developers

 First clone Devito:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devitocodes/devito.git
cd devito
```

and then install the requirements in your virtual environment (venv or conda):

```bash
# Install requirements
pip install -e .
# ...or to install additional dependencies
# pip install -e .[extras,mpi,nvidia,tests]
```
